Social Data Science
================ 
#### Teacher: Rasmus W. Schmøkel

### Fall 2022
In order to understand, produce and consume the next generation of social science studies students need to know how to implement and interpret data science methods. 
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to web based data gathering techniques, some text analyses and to simple implementations of machine learning. These tools have proven to be extremely power full and some of them are directly responsible for the automatization wave that is currently remolding and restructuring many industries including the public sector. Hence understanding how and what different models do is essential for students who want to be prepared for a labor market, which increasingly demands knowledge of where efficiency can be gained by implementing data science methods.
The course begin by an introduction to R but as already stipulated it is expected that students work on their programing skills outside class.
